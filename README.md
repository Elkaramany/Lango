Tech Stack: 
- React Native ( Typescript template )
- Firebase (firestore)
- Redux
- React Navigation

I also added some setup I had from other projects as a template like API config, assets, redux persist, some reusable components, validators, utility functions like social media auth (facebook, google and apple) and some app constants.
